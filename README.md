# UnityIL2CPPInternalTemplate
Generic Unity IL2CPP Internal DLL template (includes kiero, imgui, il2cpp resolver etc)

# Usage
Clone the repo, everything is setup there (at least how I like it) from hax.cpp to define your hooks and hacks, gui.cpp to define your menu, a nice hooks.cpp class with HooksManager to manage all your hooks!!
